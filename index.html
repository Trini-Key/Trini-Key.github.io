						<p>Pre-law hopeful turned <span class="ccode">Marine</span>. 4 years and two tours in the <span class="ccode">Marine Corps.</span> later I decided to change the direction my life was going I 
							enjoyed my time as a <span class="ccode">Marine</span>. I was fortunate enough to visit many countries during my time not just for work but also liberty. I was 
							always into computers since I was a young boy, mostly how they were made and building them myself. I later developed an enthusiasm to 
							learn how it works. What goes on behind the scenes how does it do what it does. I went to school considering first to get an engineering
							degree then back to graduate school for a <span class="ccode">Computer Science</span> Degree. I also considered Commissioning back into the <span class="ccode">Marine Corps.</span> as 
							an officer. I transferred from Wake Tech Community college to <span class="ccode">Georgia State</span> pursuing a <span class="ccode">Computer Science</span> degree. I have developed 
							skils both in and out of School. I now have experience and basic understand in C++, C#, C, Python, HTML & CSS and proficiency in 
							Java. Would love to get into Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and other knowledge based systems.
